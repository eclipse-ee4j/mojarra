/**

 *
 * <p>The "specialness" of this VariableResolver is found in its {@link
 * #resolveVariable} method, which delegates to the head of the
 * "correct" ELResolver chain based on the context in which this
 * expression is being evaluated.  If the expression being evaluated
 * originated in a JSP page, the <code>Application</code>'s
 * <code>ExpressionFactory</code> is used to create a
 * <code>ValueExpression</code>, which is then evaluated to resolve the
 * variable.  This will cause the ELResolver chain described in section
 * 5.6.1 of the spec to be used.  If the expression being evaluated
 * originated in a programmatic API call, the <code>Application</code>'s
 * <code>ELResolver</code> is used to resolve the variable.  This will
 * cause the ELResolver chain described in section 5.6.2 of the spec to
 * be used.</p>
