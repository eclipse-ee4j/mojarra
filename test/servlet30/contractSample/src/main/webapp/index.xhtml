    <body>
        <ui:composition template="/template.xhtml">
            <ui:define name="nav">
                Navigation area

                    This example demonstrates that a facelets template can come from
                    a resource library contract. What that means is that you can set
                    different areas in your application to use a different resource
                    library contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This particular page uses the 'default' contract, see contracts/default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To see how it triggers this particular template see the WEB-INF/faces-config.xml.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h:form prependId="false">
                        Click on the button and you will see that it still uses the 'default' contract.
                        <p><h:commandButton id="button" value="next" action="page2" /></p>
                    </h:form>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or if you want click on the link to go to the user area which uses the 'user' contract.
                    <a href="#{facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/faces/user/index.xhtml">User area</a>
                </p>
            </ui:define>
        </ui:composition>
