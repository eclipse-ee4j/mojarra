            <h2>Stable Test Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
		<li>3 text boxes should have been dynamically added inside the component. The first two should display '1' and '2'. The third should be blank</li>
                <li>The first two boxes will receive an auto-generated id. The third box has had its id set programmatically</li>
                <li>The third box is a required field, so when you click 'POSTback' you should see a 'Value is required' message</li>
                <li>Keep clicking 'POSTback'. The order of the boxes should not change - it should remain stable</li>
